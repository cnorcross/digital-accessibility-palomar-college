## Introduction

This document shows you how to encourage organizations to make their website accessible. Contact organizations when you find accessibility barriers on their website.

Your feedback to an organization can help them improve their website’s accessibility. This will benefit you, other people who use the website, and the organization itself. Website owners have many priorities for changes and improvements. The more an organization hears about accessibility from people who use their website, the more likely it is that accessibility will become a higher priority. Positive feedback is useful, as well as critical feedback.

Some website owners are not even aware of the importance of making their website accessible. Websites are required to be accessible in many countries by [national policies](/WAI/policies/). The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) states that people with disabilities have a right to access information and services via the Internet. Also, accessible websites provide [business benefits](/WAI/business-case/) for website owners and [benefits for people without disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/soc#groups).

Note that most accessibility barriers are caused by poor website design and development. However, some accessibility problems might be related to settings in your web browser or assistive technology. For guidance to help you customize your particular web browser and computer setup so it’s easier to use websites, see [Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing).

## Consider Your Approach

Consider what approach will get the results you want. Your tone in emails, phone calls, and other communications influences how people react and respond.

Keep in mind that there are different reasons why websites are not accessible. Some organizations don’t know about accessibility and don’t know how to make their websites accessible. Some are just learning about accessibility and trying to make their website accessible, although they might not be doing it well enough yet. And there are some organizations that choose not to make their websites accessible.

Often it is best when you first contact an organization to assume that they don’t know about the accessibility barriers on their website. You can adjust your approach based on their response and what you learn about the organization’s position on accessibility. Their response can help you choose follow up actions that are likely to be most effective.

### Asking Others to Help

Consider asking friends, family, or colleagues for help understanding the problem you are observing and communicating it to the website owner. For example, the issue may be related to the website or any assistive technologies you are using. You can also ask other to help you communicate with the website owner. For example, an advocacy group.

### Encouraging Accessible Websites

Acknowledge and encourage organizations that make an effort to be accessible. Positive feedback can motivate individuals and organizations. It can encourage other organizations to invest in web accessibility.

## Identify Key Contacts

Try to find the person responsible for the web page or application that is inaccessible. Or find the person responsible for accessibility at the organization. Sometimes you will have to use any contact you can find. Look for links on their website such as:

  * Accessibility
  * Editor, Author, Page Owner, Webmaster
  * Contact Us, Feedback, Comments
  * Help, Support, Customer Service, “FAQ” (frequently asked questions)



Some links will be email addresses, some will go to online forms, and some will provide other ways to contact the organization.

If you cannot find contacts on the website, other places to look include:

  * telephone directory
  * local library and librarian
  * local business directory
  * public companies register



## Describe the Problem

Describe the accessibility barrier clearly. This will help the organization find and fix the problem. Include:

  * the page where you found a problem
  * what the problem is that you observe
  * what computer and software you use
  * a screenshot of the web page



### Where the Problem is

Include the web address (also called URL), or a description of the page.

Examples of a web address (URL):

  * http://www.example.org/services/local.html
  * https://www.example.org/checkout/confirm.php



Examples of page descriptions:

  * “the Local Services page, the one with the lists of Residential Services and Business Services”
  * “the Confirm Purchase page after I entered my credit card information”
  * “the Search Results from the Services Directory Database”



### What the Problem is

Provide details about what you were trying to do, and why it was difficult or impossible to do it.

Examples of problem descriptions:

  * **keyboard navigation** \- I can’t get from the home page to the pages for paying my bill. I can’t use a mouse so I use Tab to get to links, but I can’t tab to the Pay Your Bills link.
  * **mouse clicking** \- It’s hard for me to get the mouse to stop on small things. In the survey, it’s hard to click the little circles. On other surveys I’ve used, I can click on the words as well as the circles, which is a lot easier.
  * **small text** \- I can’t read the bus timetables because the text is too small. I set the text size to Larger in my browser, but the text didn’t get any bigger.
  * **overlapping text** \- I had trouble reading the small text. I increased the text size in my browser, but then much of the text overlapped other text and the pictures. This made it impossible to read.
  * **color combinations** \- It’s hard to read some of the product descriptions because the colors make it hard to see the text. I have problems with blue/yellow and blue/orange color combinations.
  * **alt text** \- I’m using a screen reader to listen to your website. Screen readers can’t read images; they read the alt text from the code. The images on this page are missing alt text. For example, I hear “240.gif” which my friend tells me is an image for Special Discounts.
  * **distracting animations** \- I found the home page very confusing and it was difficult to find the information I wanted with all the animated things all over the page. They kept drawing my attention away from what I was trying to read.
  * **captions** \- I was told there are good video tutorials on your website. But I cannot get much information from the videos because I can’t hear them. The videos are missing captions.



### What Computer and Software You are Using

Provide details about your computer and software. If you don’t know, maybe a friend, relative, or colleague can help you find that information. If not, you can skip this part.

Include:

  * the **operating system** you are using, and the version (for example, Windows 10, macOS 10.13, or Linux Ubuntu 17.10)
  * the **browser** software you use to view the Web, and the version (for example, Edge, Internet Explorer (IE) 11, Firefox 60, Chrome 62.0, Opera 45, Safari 10.1.2, etc.)



Also include the following information if it relates to the problem you are having:

  * any **settings** you have customized (for example, I set the Font Size to Largest in my browser)
  * any **assistive technology** that you use (for example, screen reader, screen magnification software, voice recognition software for input)

Examples of detailed computer and software descriptions:

  * I use Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11 and Tazti voice recognition software
  * I use the NVDA screen reader version 2017.2 with Windows 10 Home edition and the Firefox browser version 60



Even if you don’t know all the details, include what you do know.

Examples of simple descriptions:

  * I use a Mac with the Safari browser and set the Universal Access to never use fonts smaller than 14.
  * I use Windows with Edge. I changed the Windows colors to give me yellow text on a black background as it’s easier to read.
  * I use the Opera browser with Windows and I use keystrokes to navigate websites. (I can’t use a mouse at all.)



_Note:_ **Do not reveal personal information such as passwords,** **via email or otherwise.** Do not provide any information that you are not comfortable disclosing.

## Include Sources for More Information

Help the organization understand web accessibility issues. Consider including the following resources:

  * [Introduction to Web Accessibility](/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)  
https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/
  * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/WAI/people-use-web/) https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/
  * [WCAG 2 Overview](/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)  
https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/



## Request Reply

Ask the organization to reply to you. If you are comfortable giving your phone number, include your number in case they want to discuss the problem.

## Follow-Up as Needed

Responsible organizations will follow up with you. However, sometimes you might need to follow up with them.

### Be Available for Follow-up

The website developers might need more information from you to help them diagnose and fix the problem.

### Keep Records for Further Follow-Up

You might need records if you later decide to take further action. In particular:

  * Keep copies of the website when you first encounter the problem. For example, take screenshots, save the pages on your hard drive, or print the pages. If the website changes, make new copies of it.
  * Keep printed or electronic copies of all correspondence, including email, postal mail, and online forms.
  * Keep records of all phone calls. Include the dates, the names of who you talked with, and notes on what was said.



### Getting a Response

You might get a quick response, or it might take longer to hear back. It depends on the organization’s culture, policies, and internal systems. Government agencies and other organizations providing public services may be required to respond.

You might get an automatic reply that the organization received your feedback. The organization should follow up later with a direct reply to your issue.

Sometimes the organization does not have expertise in accessibility. They may not understand your feedback. They might assume the issue is with your browser or assistive technology.

The organization might fix the problem and not notify you.

If you do not receive satisfactory responses within a reasonable timeframe, consider taking further action, described below.

### Further Action to Consider

If you feel the organization is not adequately resolving the accessibility problem, consider taking further action. For example:

  * Contact an advocacy group to see if they will get involved.
  * Contact the organization’s senior management, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Managing Director, or Chief Business Officer.
  * Use online community resources, such as blogging or social networking, to tell others about the inaccessible website. Share what the organization did in response to your contact.
  * Contact the press or write a “letter to the editor”.
  * Starting a petition (maybe online).
  * If it is a government website, contact your local government.
  * Lodge a formal complaint with the relevant industry regulator or ombudsman.
  * Contact the government department responsible for disability rights, older people’s rights, or human rights.
  * Consider legal action. For example, based on web accessibility requirements in [anti-discrimination regulations in your country](/WAI/policies/).

### Sample Email 1

**Subject:** Problem with Citylights' ticket page

Dear Citylights Marketing Manager,

I have encountered some accessibility barriers on your website.

I recently visited your ticket offers page (http://www.cl.example.com/tickets/mank.html) looking for tickets for Thelonius Mank. I couldn’t use the page because the gray text on the black background is too hard to read.

You can get information about web accessibility from the web page at https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/

As I am a CityLights’ events fan, I would appreciate your attention to this problem - please let me know when it’s fixed. If you would like me to supply any further information, please email me.

Regards,  
Maria

### Sample Email 2

**Subject:** Accessibility of Citylights' news page

Hello Citylights Director,

Your news page (http://www.cl.example.com/news/news.html) is not accessible. I listen to web pages with the NVDA screen reader (version 2017.2). I use Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 11.

My colleague told me that you had some heat wave information so I went to the news page, however there was something strange going on. I found a sentence about the heat wave and temperatures, but then there was something about the violin case man. Much of the page seemed mixed up and was confusing for me to listen to - it appears it was not written in a linear fashion so that someone like me using a screen reader can understand it.

Also, your news page doesn’t have any headings. Headings are important because I use them to get an overview of the page and to help me navigate to the stories.

Please check out this web accessibility information from the W3C:

  * [Introduction to Web Accessibility](/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)

Please let me know when these problems are addressed.

Thank you for your attention.

### Sample Email 3

**Subject:** Problem accessing Citylights' surveys

Hi Citylights,

Love your stories, but not your surveys! I can’t use a mouse very much because my arms don’t work well. Usually I tab around web pages. Anyway, on your survey page I was only able to get to the question about how many cars we have when I tabbed around. When I did try using the mouse to answer the ‘where do I live’ question, I couldn’t click on the words like I can on many other sites’ forms, I had to click the little circle before the words.

In case it helps you diagnose and fix the problem: I have a Win10 laptop and use Chrome browser Version 60.0.3112.78.

To learn more about these and other accessibility issues, check out www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/

By the way, making your site accessible will benefit Citylights too, see Developing a Digital Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization (www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/).

Please tell me when you’ve fixed these problems. Happy to help you further. You can ring me at 12-345-6789.

Best,  
Jasmine

Terminology specifically related to people with disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies is provided in [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/WAI/people-use-web/).

## Essentials for Teaching Accessibility

The following tips help you provide more effective courses, training, and certification programs on accessibility:

  * **Involve people with disabilities** — Involve people with disabilities in your courses so that students get perspectives from real people on the impact of accessibility barriers and accessibility features. Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, the accessibility features they rely on, and barriers they encounter. If you cannot invite people with disabilities, consider using videos instead. Yet make sure to guide your students through the process to avoid perpetuating existing misunderstandings. For guidance on working with people with disabilities, ethical considerations, and cautions, see [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility](/WAI/planning/involving-users/).
  * **Include the reasons for accessibility features** — Include the _why_ , not just the _how_. For example, students should know why to provide text alternatives, not just how to. Students learn and implement accessibility more effectively when they understand the reasons behind accessibility features and how people with disabilities use them.
  * **Cover all disabilities** — Avoid inadvertently prioritizing some types of disabilities over others. Digital accessibility is essential for people with many different types of disabilities, including auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual. For guidance on cross-disability aspects, see [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/WAI/people-use-web/).
  * **Approach accessibility holistically** — Communicate accessibility as part of the broader umbrella of inclusion and diversity. Explain that accessibility is not effectively addressed with a checklist mindset. The goal of accessibility is to improve the user experience for people with disabilities. It provides many benefits, including for users without disabilities. For an explanation of how accessibility is related to usability and inclusive design, see [Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion](/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/).
  * **Make it accessible** — Ensure that the course itself is accessible. For example: 
    * all presentations, teaching materials, exercises, assessments, and other student interactions are accessible
    * the online learning platform, the classroom, computer lab, and training venue are accessible
    * captions, sign-language, and large-print is provided when needed
    * instructors describe visual information, including text on the screen

For specific guidance on making your training accessible, see [Making Events Accessible: Checklist for meetings, conferences, training, and presentations that are remote/virtual, in-person, or hybrid](/WAI/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).
